	"description": "Homegear assigns a unique id to each script. This id is used to identify the script in different threads. Additionally a password token is generated, so a script can not accidently register as a different script. getScriptId() returns the id and the token for the current script. The returned string can then be used to register new threads using \"<a href=\"#HomegearregisterThread\">registerThread()</a>\". getScriptId() only returns valid data, if this method is called within the main thread or after \"<a href=\"#HomegearregisterThread\">registerThread()</a>\" has been called.",
