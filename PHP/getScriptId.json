	"description": "Homegear assigns a unique ID to each script. This ID is used to identify the script in different threads. Additionally, a password token is generated, which means that any given script cannot accidently register as a different script. getScriptId() returns the ID and the token for the current script. The string that is returned can then be used to register new threads using \"<a href=\"#HomegearregisterThread\">registerThread()</a>\". getScriptId() returns valid data only if this method is called in the main thread or after \"<a href=\"#HomegearregisterThread\">registerThread()</a>\" has been called.",
